Artists from all over the state are creating, inspiring, and participating in protests as a reaction to the unjust killings of Black women and men across the nation. Much like the music inspired by the fight for civil rights in the sixties, the music released during this time will no doubt become linked hand in hand with memories of the movement. Check out the selections released recently below.

Houston's very own Queen Bey released her new song "Black Parade" in celebration of [Juneteenth](https://blacktexan.com/juneteenth-already-holiday) this past weekend. She says the upbeat track will benefit black own business and artists, which she [linked to on her Instagram](https://www.beyonce.com/black-parade-route/). Not one to shy away from social activism and Black uplifting, Bey sings:

>Rubber bullets bouncing off me, made a picket sign off your picket fence, take it as a warning

An extended version of Black Parade is available on [Tidal.](https://listen.tidal.com/album/145850339)

Little is known specifically of the makeup and origin of the critically acclaimed group Sault, though much [speculated](theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/sault-5-7-review-forever-living-originals). They soar past their already high heights on their latest release which is deeply rooted in the present moment of Black experience. Through addictive rhythyms and beautiful melodies, Sault uplift and narrate the beauty, joys, and challenges of Blackness.

Finally, last week dropped the audio for her new somber and thought song "I Can't Breathe". With an extensive, personal spoken word section. H.E.R. makes it plain her view on the current tragedies of this world.
