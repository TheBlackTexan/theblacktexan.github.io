News of [Chadwick Boseman's passing](https://twitter.com/chadwickboseman/status/1299530165463199747) last night hit me like a Mack Truck. In a year that's felt at times like a waking nightmare it's surprising how surprising his death was for us all. A man of his talent, charisma, and grace was taken from us too soon and it's a shame. Although he'd packed into 4 years the kind of career most actors would die for, it was obvious there was much more on the horizon for his career as an actor, role-model, and activist. His impact on the culture is immense, his legacy already tremendous. One thing is certain, from depicting historical Black role-models to embodying the [complexity of our past](https://blacktexan.com/Da-5-Bloods-Review), Chadwick was a real life hero.

I remember the hype I had for Captain America: Civil War. Yes, Spider-Man was going to be in it, Yes, Iron Man was going to fight Cap but what I was most excited to see however was the debut appearance of Black Panther in the MCU. The suit was sleek and the regal presence of T'challa was apparent even in the teaser trailers; and all of this was being brought to life by none other Boseman. As soon as I saw Boseman in the role it just felt... right. Going to the theater and seeing the entirety of his performance only solidfied my view; Boseman was born to play T'challa. Boseman seemed destined to play a lot of Black legends, really. I'd seen him first as Jackie Robinson in 42 and remembered thinking, "This guy's got it. He's going to be a star for sure." Sometimes you can just tell and it was never more apparent than with an actor like Boseman for me. The steady power in his performances were always captivating.

Which is why when I learned that T'challa would be getting a feature length solo movie, I immediately began praying the Lord would allow me to live long enough just to see it. I'm a grown man and I'm not ashamed to say I was giddy in anticipation for the first Black MCU film. Helmed by my favorite up and coming director, Ryan Coogler, co-starring the magnetic Michael B. Jordan, and the Academy Award winning Lupita Nyong'o, I had never wanted to see a movie more.

You remember the build up to this movie. I remember the reading the text that Kendrick Lamar would be releasing an album to coincide with the film and replying "Okay Disney is doing it right." I read/watched every promotional and press material I could find and every cast interview. It was certain that this was going to be big. This was going to be an event. Celebrities were planning showings for schools and encouraging everyone to go see this movie and support. It felt like one of those moments in history where the entire African diaspora was united. I remember in 2008 on election night, being able to high-five or hug any black person I saw anywhere and them not only knowing what was up but returning the embrace. This was like that, like we were all waiting with collective bated breath.

And boy did it deliver; the most succesfull domestic movie of 2018, Academy Awards, glowing reviews. Most importantly it gave us heros. We have them already, don't get me wrong. Many are already etched into the Black history books that have achieved super hero status but never before had we'd seen ourselves quite like this. T'challa was a king, a just ruler that could go head to head with the literal embodiment of American strength. I can only imagine the impact something like that will have on this young generation of black boys and girls to be able to see themselves in that way and in the same place that they see the biggest heros on screen.

It is this impact I am thankful for. Boseman carried the grace and compassion of T'challa right off the set and into the real world because that's who he was. As we learn the specifics of his illness, it becomes apparent that while he fought for his life he was doing all he could to depict Black role-models on screen. To show those that follow him that you could be a king, a super-hero, a judge, or a superstar. He was more than an actor, he was setting an example that anything was possible for a Black person. We should be eternally greatful and strive to carry on his legacy.

Simply, it was second nature for Boseman to play all our favorite heros because he was one. Rest in peace and power.
