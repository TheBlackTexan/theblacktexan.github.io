Welp Texans, it is 4th of July and we are still dealing with the spread of Covid-19, now more than ever in fact. As we start our 4th of July celebrations, it is *still* important to heed the warnings of our state government and medical officials, especially for those of us in the black community as we are more likely to be seriously affected by the disease due to ["long-standing systemic health and social inequities".](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html) That's right, after years and years of inviting anyone and everyone to the "cookout", this year it is best to keep our celebrations small.

I get it, the thought of going out and hanging with friends after the stress of being cooped up with minimal social contact during this quarantine sounds great. In fact, if you've got a bubble of friends or family you've been isolating with under 10 people, that is still under the recommended number for gatherings. This is not the time, however, for the big, twenty plus people Independence Day bash. As I asked [earlier this week](https://blacktexan.com/houstonians-should-apologize) is one day of partying worth exposing yourself and others to this deadly virus. I hope not.

In addition, like Kapernick's choice to kneel, having a huge celebration for a country that has yet to live out the true meaning of it's creed... doesn't feel quite right. I'd rather protest than parades, right now. *"But Jarrett! Independence Day, like all American holidays, is about saluting, thanking, and commemorating the military!!"* Well on that note, let's commemorate native Houstonian, Vanessa Guillen, who has gone missing---[FBI presumed murdered](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/03/887167023/fbi-files-charges-in-vanessa-guillen-case)---after reporting sexual harassment she received while on base at Fort Hood. I don't know if fireworks, hotdogs, and pool parties during the midst of a pandemic is the best way to salute her and the many like her right now. I could be wrong though. What is certain though, is the deadly impact this virus is having on Texas; and that masks, social distancing and limiting large gatherings is the best way to curb the spread.

Local government officials say the same:

I promise you, there will be more times for us to gather together again and celebrate but the quickest way to get there is to wear masks and social distance until infection rates start to go back down. America has suffered more and longer from Covid-19 than any other wealthy country. Maybe our focus today should be on gaining our independence from this virus.
