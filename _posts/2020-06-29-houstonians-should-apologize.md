"When did we lose our respect for human life? Since when did we decide as a society that instead of saving a life ... we would treat human lives as collateral damage?...", Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo questioned in her remarks at a press conference last week where they announced Harris County was now at its highest emergency threat level. Shortly thereafter Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner called for Houstonians to unite again and flatten the curve and progression of the virus. Watching these two officials do all they could petitioning their constituents to join together for the wellbeing of others again, I realized that we all owe these two an apology, including myself.

That's right, I, like most at the start heeded the warnings and the stay at home, work safe orders; I wore a mask in public and sanitized my hands regularly. As time went on though, and the perceived threat of the virus decreased, I laxed in my commitment to wearing a mask. As Governor Abbot opened the state up, I began to start going to restaurants and public gatherings all the while still tweeting and commenting with a sense of superiority as to how callous "other people" were taking this pandemic. I then received the news that I had eaten with and hung out without wearing mask aroung someone who had tested positive for the virus. The immediate feelings of guilt and panic were overwhelming. Thankfully I have since tested negative for the virus but at the time I sought to place blame on government officials for opening up the state prematurely (though that is the case) or for others who put themselves in situations to spread the virus. I quickly realized how hypocritical I'd been.

After listening to the numerous pleas for caution and to follow medical advice from Turner and Hidalgo, at the first sign of the state opening back up, I started trying to return to normal. For the few days I was waiting for my test results, the pain of thinking I could have jeopardized my loved ones was immense. Even though I was quick to defend the measures states were ordering to stop the spread on social media, I had been negligent in my own life. I put my own desires above the well-being of my fellow Houstonians against the advisement of our own officials. So let me be the first to say sorry Houston and sorry Hidalgo and Turner for taking your guidance for granted.

I hope other Houstonians do the same; not just with our words but with our actions. For instance, just a month ago Hidalgo was sued in attempt to block [her order requiring county residents to wear masks for a month.](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/04/23/harris-county-face-mask-lina-hidalgo/) This suit was indicative of the opinions of a large number of residents, who saw the order as an affront of their liberties and overstepping. I can't tell you how many people I heard or saw say "They can't make me wear a mask" or strongly criticized her actions. Likewise, Houstonians collectively did not heed the stern warnings for the Mayor. And to clear again, I'm not just talking about the people who barge into grocery stores, face uncovered blathering about their rights, I must also condemn those like myself who casually eased back into "normal life". In hindsight it has clear that Hidalgo's and Turner's actions were not the first steps of a [tyrannical dicatorship](http://baytownsun.com/opinion/article_21a5af1a-869d-11ea-b177-cf40e8d8d121.html) but true and earnest attempts for us all to take care of one another.

Hidalgo's questions of Houstonians' respect for life are spot on. Now more than ever we must heed their guidance and put the lives of our fellow Texans above our own pleasure. As the City of Houston becomes a placeholder for "worst case scenario/hotspot", much like Italy and Wuhan once were, are we going to continue to jeopardize one another by [going on with our lives as usual?](https://houston.eater.com/2020/6/29/21306859/spire-houston-nightclub-open-despite-gov-abbott-ordering-bars-closed-covid-19-pandemic) I hope and beg not. I'm thankful I have the opportunity to admit I was wrong and seek to be better. An afternoon patio dinner at Chuy's isn't worth the pain of the loss of life and suffering caused by this virus.
