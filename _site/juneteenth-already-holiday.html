While this illuminating time and movement for change in this nation is inspiring, if I had to choose between corporations sending out tweets for Juneteenth and justice for Breonna Taylor, the choice is easy. If it’s between Aunt Jemima and holding police departments accountable for the crimes they’ve committed against the citizens they are supposed to protect, I choose accountability.

While this illuminating time and movement for change in this nation is inspiring, if I had to choose between corporations sending out tweets for Juneteenth and justice for Breonna Taylor, the choice is easy. If it’s between <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/business/racist-brands-aunt-jemima-chiquita/index.html">Aunt Jemima</a> and holding police departments accountable for the crimes they’ve committed against the citizens they are supposed to protect, I choose accountability.

Blacks want both, to be clear, but in the midst of all that’s going on in America it’s important not to lose focus. Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II said it best:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center "><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some are calling for Juneteenth to be a national holiday. How about we go further &amp; pass healthcare &amp; living wages for all, a fully restored Voting Rights Act &amp; reparations, etc. Please don’t just ask for a holiday. Let’s make it a holy day of repentance &amp; reconstruction.</p>&mdash; Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II (@RevDrBarber) <a href="https://twitter.com/RevDrBarber/status/1273993146960052225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I commend all who for whatever reason are just now learning about Juneteeth and other parts of the Black experience and are doing their best to listen and educate themselves. There is plenty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/juneteenth-day-celebration.html">written about the holiday</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-is-juneteenth/">it’s history.</a> Hopefully lessons we collectively take from Juneteenth lead us to substantive change for Black communities and not just a day off work and sales on bedding and furniture like other holidays. Without changes to corporate hiring policies, inclusion in leadership positions and bias training, the various corporate acknowledgements  ring hollow. If the Breonna Taylor’s murderers are allowed to continue on with their lives without being tried for their crimes, <a href="https://www.wlky.com/article/gov-beshear-signs-proclamation-making-friday-juneteenth-national-freedom-day/32910987">proclamations from the governor</a> are just words. This moment in America started not to get a day off from work, though that is a great result, but to seek justice for those wronged by it’s system of oppression.</p>

<blockquote class="alignleft">“Hopefully lessons we collectively take from Juneteenth lead us to substantive change for Black communities and not just a day off work and sales on bedding and furniture like other holidays."</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, Juneteenth will continue to be a holiday for Black Texans and Americans whether the president acknowledges it all, just like it’s always been. Like New Year’s watch meetings, we will continue to commemorate and celebrate the sacrifices of those who came before us, that’s who we are. However, If we want to be like our forerunners who fought for their and our freedom, let’s be mindful not to just fight for holidays though and instead work for positive change and making this nation a better place for those that follow us.</p>
